# Project Title

Morse Code Translator

## Overview

The Morse Code Translator is a Python application designed to facilitate seamless translation between plain text and Morse Code, enhancing communication versatility. The project includes a user-friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Morse Code Converter. Users can input text and receive Morse Code output, or vice versa, with clear instructions and prompts. The application utilizes efficient algorithms to ensure fast and accurate translation while optimizing resource utilization.

## Key Features

- **Text to Morse Code Translation:**
  - Enables users to translate plain text to Morse Code, expanding communication options.

- **Morse Code to Text Translation:**
  - Facilitates the translation of Morse Code back to plain text, ensuring bidirectional communication.

- **User-Friendly Interfaces:**
  - Implemented both a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to accommodate users with varying preferences and provide clear instructions and prompts.

- **Efficient Algorithms:**
  - Utilizes efficient algorithms for text-to-Morse and Morse-to-text translation, ensuring fast and accurate results while optimizing resource utilization.

## Getting Started

To use the Morse Code Translator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   - For the CLI version:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - For the GUI version:
     visit https://morse-translator.onrender.com/

4. **Input and Translate:**
   - Follow the instructions to input text or Morse Code and receive the translated output.
   - ###Text to Morse###

Type letters, numbers and punctuation and the Morse code will appear. Characters that cannot be translated are skipped. 

###Morse to Text###

Type Morse code using "*" for a dot and "-" for a dash. Letters are separated by spaces and words by "/". The text translation will appear. Characters that cannot be translated are skipped. 

## Efficient Translation Algorithms

The Morse Code Translator employs efficient algorithms for translation, ensuring the following:

- **Fast Translation:**
  - Translates text to Morse Code and vice versa swiftly for a responsive user experience.

- **Accuracy:**
  - Provides accurate translation results, maintaining the integrity of the original message.

- **Optimized Resource Utilization:**
  - Optimizes resource usage to ensure the application runs efficiently on various systems.
